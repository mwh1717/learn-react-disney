This project was created utilizing a tutorial as a first step in taking a deep dive into ReactJS framework, with a few things added here and there.

Things to note:
  1. react-router-dom v5 is used in the tutorial, which is now outdated. v6 was used in this repo to be more current with the tech, which I must say is way more slick.

:-) thanks for viewing
