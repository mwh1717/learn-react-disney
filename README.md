This project was created utilizing a tutorial as a first step in taking a deep dive into ReactJS framework, with a few things added here and there.

Things to note:
  1. react-router-dom v5 is used in the tutorial, which is now outdated. v6 was used in this repo to be more current with the tech, which I must say is way more slick.
  2. back end used is Google Firebase, which was also outdated and new tech to me. got to spend some time digging through the firebase docs properly set up back end connection - sadly after digging it has been found that the tutorial's database is no longer in working order. stopping project here and will be picking up on a personal project utilizing a node backend and various API calls.

:-) thanks for viewing
